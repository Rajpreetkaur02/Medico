best care anywhere!

## Description

Medico is a website that helps you find a bed in top healthcare facilities. Further to make it more secure and reliable, it utilises the blockchain technology to book beds and generates a NFT token after the booking.

## Problem solved

In an emergency, no one has time to stand in queues or call every other hospital to check whether they can get a bed, so we created Medico, a website that helps you find a bed in top healthcare facilities. The website provides results for specific hospitals as per the requirement like cancer, cardiac, and emergency hospitals. To make the process more smooth and more secure at the same time, we have made use of blockchain technology to book beds. The patient books a bed by connecting the metamask wallet. After successfull payment an NFT token is generated which can be further traded by the customer anytime. It is added to the collectibles.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenge we faced is uploading NFT's to IPFS and retreiving it back to the website. However, we were flexible enough to get the function works on our website.

Another challenge we faced is fetching the data from API as there was no proper API for the availability of beds.

 It was hard to find relatable illustrations and resources.

Time management, as there was a lot of research involved in this project.
